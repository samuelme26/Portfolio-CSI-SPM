                <h2>Samuel Mekala</h2>
                <p>Hello Guys, I'm Samuel and I am from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. I am currently pursuing the first year of my Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science And Business Systems from VIT-AP University.I am really happy to step into my college
                    life which will give me more freedom and explore new skills. I did my schooling at Sri Chaitanya School Vijayawada. I have a beautiful family of four members. My father is a School Principal. My mother is a Lab Technician . I have
                    one younger brother who is currently studying 10th class. My strengths are I'm an open minded person, I am very optimistic in every situation and I believe everything happens for a reason. So even when there are a lot of negative effects,
                    I look for that one positive side. My weakness is that I'm afraid of asking for help, however, I am learning to ask for help from others to expedite my own work. My hobbies are playng cricket, listening music and playing piano etc...
                    I was recently joined in CSI club. I'm Very happy to be a part in CSI Chapter.</p>
